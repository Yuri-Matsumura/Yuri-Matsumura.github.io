\textbf{JOB MARKET PAPER}\\
“Evaluating Cartel Impact in Procurement Auctions”\\
Abstract: From 2018 to 2020, four incumbent firms engaged in a cartel in Japan's electricity retail market. During this period, they implemented a market allocation scheme, withdrawing from each other's sales regions to maximize individual profits. This paper examines the cartel's impact on procurement auctions for selecting electricity suppliers to public buildings.
The analysis reveals two key findings: (1) cartel members significantly reduced their participation rates in procurement auctions outside their designated regions, and (2) when they did participate, they often submitted non-competitive (phony) bids.
The study also finds that when cartel members participate in auctions held in other members' designated regions, the share of efficient auction decreased. 
However, the resulting efficiency loss was not significant. 
This suggests that while the cartel had a notable impact on bids and participation rates, its overall effect on auction efficiency was relatively limited.
